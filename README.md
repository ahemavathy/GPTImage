## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Azure OpenAI configuration is missing"**
   - Ensure all environment variables are set in `.env.local`
   - Check that both GPT Image and GPT-4o resources are active
   - Verify deployment names match your Azure deployments

2. **"Failed to generate/edit images"**
   - Verify your API keys and deployment names
   - Check if you have access to both APIs
   - Ensure your Azure subscription has sufficient credits

3. **"PowerPoint generation failed"**
   - **Service Not Running**: Ensure the PowerPoint service is running on the configured port
     - Check if `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured URL) is accessible
     - Download and set up the service from: https://github.com/ahemavathy/Powerpoint
   - **Port Configuration**: Verify `POWERPOINT_API_BASE_URL` in your `.env.local` matches the running service
   - **Image Upload Issues**: Check if image upload to PowerPoint API succeeded
   - **JSON Format**: Ensure slide content JSON is properly formatted
   - **Service Dependencies**: Make sure the PowerPoint service has all required dependencies installed

4. **"The default export is not a React Component"**
   - Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
   - Restart the development server
   - Check for syntax errors in page components

5. **Content Filter Errors**
   - Ensure descriptions don't contain inappropriate content
   - Try rephrasing prompts with more professional language
   - Use the prompt enhancement feature for structured, professional prompts
   - Check Azure OpenAI content policy guidelines

6. **Prompt Enhancement Issues**
   - **Dropdown Visibility**: All dropdown options now have improved text contrast for better readability
   - **Option Selection**: Choose complementary options (e.g., ceramic + glossy finish + studio lighting)
   - **Preview Not Updating**: Check that enhancement options are selected before clicking "Apply Enhanced Prompt"
   - **Reset Feature**: Use "Reset All" to clear all enhancement selections and start over

### Performance Issues

- **Slow image generation**: Azure OpenAI processing time varies
- **Large file uploads**: Check file size limits and network speed
- **Memory issues**: Reduce number of images processed simultaneously

### API Rate Limits

Azure OpenAI services have rate limits:
- Wait between requests if hitting rate limits
- Consider upgrading your Azure OpenAI pricing tier
- Monitor usage in Azure portal
